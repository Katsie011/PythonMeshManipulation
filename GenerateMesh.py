Code by: Michael Katsoulis

This code generates points withing a 2D/3D enviroment. 
It takes in the size of the mesh and how many points need to be placed
and then randomly places the points.

Something like:
+--------------------------------------------------+
|          xx        x                             |
|    x        x               x   x                |
|      x  x               x                        |
|       x    x x     x xx                x         |
|         x                  x                x    |
